                    The project manager shall easily select and add tasks to create a new project sprint. The ability to peak a task quickly shall also be present.</p>

                    Understanding and defining the problem

                <p class="content-text">
                    John, who happens to be a project manager for a valley-based startup called Startup XYZ is managing a small cross-functional team of designers, developers, and testers.<br> <br>
                    According to John, he takes a ferry every day to work and while sipping his coffee, he has 10–15 free minutes in which he wants to be able to quickly create a weekly sprint before entering the office so every Monday, he can gather the team for a standup meeting and discuss the sprint. The sprint can also be for a single team only.<br> <br>
                    <b>So the task at hand is to design a user flow for a project management app where the project manager can simply look at the tasks and quickly create a sprint.</b></p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    A small independent ideation workshop was conducted where possible ideas were Quick wireframes were designed first to define a solution space onto which multiple options were prototyped.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="content-text">
                    The designs were tested screen by screen. Hi-fidelity designs were crafted for each idea and the screens were prototpyed according to the defined flow. A modern design was created. The projects' home screen had the active elements and each project had its most important elements upfront. The project has a dasbhoard like view to display the important information such as task breakdown. Cards were used to represent the task and a very human interaction was employed to add them to the sprint - fling. Its a very humanizing interaction because it depicts the activity of sorting or dealing a deck of cards. The user can glance at the details of the task as well. The final screen is a lovely feedback animation that shows that the sprint has been completed.

                <p class="content-text">
                    All the animations and interactions were paced at 0.4s to follow <a href="https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold" target="_blank">Doherty's Law of UX Design</a>. A nice little cubic-bezier function is used as well for smooth transitions.

                <p class="content-text">
                    What design is design without actually testing the product, right? Before sending out the prototype to our stakeholder, I tested the app interactions on a real device myself. There were multiple changes noted and done to improve the usability of the screens.
